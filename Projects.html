							<p>
								<br>
								Description:<br>
								- Building Virtual Worlds (BVW) is a course in which students develop games in teams.<br>
								- Students do 5 projects for BVW in total, and each project lasts two weeks. Teams develop games under 
								an agile framework, and teams will be shuffled after each project, so that students face differnent
								members each round. <br>
								<br>
								My Tasks:<br>
								- Used Unity and C# to program games and complete different game play logics.<br>
								- Cooperated in teams with artists and sound designers.<br>
								- Created simple assets with Maya and improved virtual environments with shaders and lighting effect.<br>
								<br>
